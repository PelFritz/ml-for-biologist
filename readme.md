# Machine learning for biologist/bioinformaticians

This project contains jupyter notebooks to guide biologist and bioinformaticians with little knowledge of applying machine learning
or deep learning on biological datasets.
 
### Prerequisites
1. Familiarity with python programming.
2. Desire to learn new scientific terms.
3. A computer with reasonable computational power and internet connection.
4. All notebooks can be run from google collab which should take care of the troubles with setting up your own working environment. However,
I strongly encourage you to try setting up your conda environment. It is part of the learning curve.
